OWASP ZAP
Open Web Application Security Project - People making web penetration testing easier.

Zap allows you to test

OWASP ZAP is all local and allows you to see web traffic (communication between browser and web server)

Green button in zap will break at a request
It will display all headers for the request that was attiring to be sent

HTTP requests send HTML and Receive HTML headers

Shows the headers and body of a request
Requests can be edited by programs before they are sent and zap can let you change the requests again

The HTML/JS may have a filter function to change input

Zap checks requests being sent on the client side
It works well for client side sanitization

SQL Injection
SQL: database of information
Putting something that shouldn't be there into some place

SQL query : normally works with a username and password

SQL tries putting in weird things like ' and other weird characters
Tries to put in a true expression

Sets up if(true) instead of if (password = pw)

If username = '' or if 1=1-- (-- comments out the password)

' or 1=1; --
' or "a" = "a"; -- -
\ can be valid

Apostrophe breaks out into SQL or 1=1; is the true SQL command and -- comments out the password stuff

Solutions: input sanitization removes characters like apostrophes from input

To check for an SQL injection check with a single ' and look for an error
Error means its vulnerable to an injection

XSS (Cross Site Scripting) - Injection of javascript into a page

Puts JS into a div

Instead of script tags you can pass an image tag that is invalid and call javaScript on error

You can slide JS into a page with various tags

<sc<script>ript> alert("hey") </sc</script>ript>
