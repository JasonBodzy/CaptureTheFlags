RomanCipher

The Roman Cipher is a method of encryption that encrypts text based on a designated shift value. A shift value tells how far to shift 
along the alphabat. A shift value of 3 would push every letter in a given text 3 letters down the alphabet.

EX: Shift Value 3:
A -> D
B -> E
C - > F

The program I wrote is able to take any encrypted input and test encrypt it using all shift valeus. By printing each shift value, the user can 
see what the original unencrypted text is. The program currently uses the input "AOPZ PZ LUJYFWALK ALEA", which was originally
"THIS IS ENCRYPTED TEXT" shifted 7 characters down the alphabet. To change the encrypted input, simply change the input string. All possible 
output is printed in the terminal.
