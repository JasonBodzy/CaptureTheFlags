Public key crypto relies on hard problems 
Public-private key pair
A mod N : a * a^-1 = 1 mod N

RSA definition
Two hidden prime numbers
p,q
N = p*q

Cipher text = m^e % N
Private key is decrypted d^-1 % N

To encrypt it take the power of the message % n, to decrypt do the inverse

practice: github.com/andrewfhou/bootcamp-2021-crypto/

If m^e is less than n, mod n won't do anything and c will be nothing
