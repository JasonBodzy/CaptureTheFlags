# CaptureTheFlags

These are projects performed as a part of a challenge initiative called Capture the Flag. 

Capture the flag challenges are a fun and safe way to improve hacking and coding skills.
Challenges can range from decoding and encryption to exploitation and reverse engineering. 
Succesful completion of a challenge will result in being rewarded a flag (i.e. "flag{you win}")

I have been solving these challenges as a Computer Science student at Purdue University as a part of a group called B01lers.
B01lers is the Capture the Flag group at Purdue.
